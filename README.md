# FYP-Satellite-Population-of-Distant-Galaxies
Our FYP involving the use of the James Webb Telescope to find Milky Way Progenitors and their satellites. The project aims to explore the mutual effect between progenitors and their satellites by comparing the quenching likelihood (shut down of star formation) of satellites to equivalent mass and redshift host galaxies, and by comparing the evolution of the Milky Way's U-V rest colour and stellar mass to that of the found progenitors.
